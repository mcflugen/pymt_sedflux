summary:
  Plume simulates the sediment transport and deposition of single-grain size
  sediment from a river mouth entering into a marine basin by creating a
  turbulent jet. The model calculates a steady-state hypopycnal plume as a
  result of river water and sediment discharge based on simplified
  advection-diffusion equations. The model allows for plume deflection due to
  systematic coastal currents or Coriolis force
