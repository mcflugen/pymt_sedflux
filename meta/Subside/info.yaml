summary:
  The model is used to simulate the lithospheric load changes as the model
  evolves. Depending upon how the load distribution develops, this flexure
  can result in the basin uplifting or subsiding (or both). The pattern of
  subsidence in time and space largely determines the gross geometry of
  time-bounded units because it controls the rate at which space is created
  for sedimentation.
